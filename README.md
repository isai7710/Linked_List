# Linked_List
This is a Linked List library I've developed to get a better grasp at CMake, Test Driven Development, and the Linked List structure in general (singly and doubly). Written in a WSL environment on Visual Studio Code.
The src directory contains the source code for the Singly and Doubly linked list, which are just .h files. Although not shown in this repository (for the sake of simplicity) there must be a directory with the google test framework copied from the appropriate github repository, so that the unit tests in the linked_list_unittest directory work properly. The link to that Gtest repository is: https://github.com/google/googletest
